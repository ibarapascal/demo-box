## Instructions

### 1. Providding

This is a place built to serve static blog/demo documents, it could provide:

- Write markdown, render as documents with react.  
- Github/StackOverflow styled markdown.  
- Syntax highlighting code piece with customized scripts/styles combination.  
- Iframe in-place demo supported, like `codesandbox`.  
- Customizable story layout (free to use pure react/jsx/tsx code with markdown interspersed inside each story).

### 2. Convenience

Aiming at the realistic demands, it's easy to use because:

- Configs like rank/tags for the stories.  
- Minimum constant definition for new stories.  
- URL access for each story.  
- [wip]Quick search/filter via the configs.  

### 3. Tech

To achieve the above issues, it's using:

- Dynamically imported components (no need to touch `index.js` anymore when you add a story).
- Declaratively loaded js script (enable syntax highlight script with `react-router-dom`).
- Design/implement using React, Material-UI, Redux, etc.  
- Optimized performance.  

### 4. Under Construction

The project is still under construction, there would be more documentation about this in the near future, in the field of:

- [WIP] One usage example served by `gh-pages` (which is I'm going to use with demo/blog contents).  
- [WIP] One maintained branch to folk.
- [WIP] Document about what it could do in specific.  
- [WIP] Document about the steps of how to add your own stories.
