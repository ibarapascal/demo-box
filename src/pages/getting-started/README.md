# Getting Started

## What's in here

This is the place where I put my code piece and sample demos.

Built using React, Material-UI, codesandbox, it could provide markdown written documentation of code, as well as the in-place demo.

## Why build this

As long as the answer in StackOverflow is growing, I found it's hard for me to search it through.

People do forget things, it just came to the point that I need to make a summary.

Although the storybook, hugo like libs seem to be good solutions, I decided to build this on my own using React.

## How to watch

From the tabs in the left hand.

Each demo/story has a unique URL to navigate.

Complex search via title, tags, stars would be supported later.
